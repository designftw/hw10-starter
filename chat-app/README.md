# Graffiti Chat Lab

This lab provides a basic working chat application that supports direct messaging and channel-based discussion.
You can try out the app [here](https://graffiti.garden/chat-lab/).

The app is built using the [Graffiti infrastructure](https://graffiti.garden).
You can find reference material on Graffiti's Vue interface [here](https://graffiti.garden/vue-plugin).

## Overview of Graffiti

Graffiti apps are designed to be both *interoperable* and *flexible*.
That means that you should be able to send messages from one chat app and receive them in another
while **also** having the freedom to add features to your chat app that might change the data schema that it uses.

To meet both of those design goals, Graffiti uses the following pattern:
- Find a large collection of potentially relevant data.
- Filter out any data that your app cannot use.
- Process the remaining data for display in your interface.

This chat app uses this work flow to:
- Fetch all data in your "inbox" or a channel, filter that data for message data, and display those messages.
- Fetch all data related to a user's identity, filter that data for the user's most recent profile data, and display name in the profile.

## Graffiti Objects

The data that we're filtering is an array of special JSON objects that have the following default properties:

- `published`: This is the timestamp that the data was published.
- `updated`: This is the timestamp that the data was last updated
- `id`: This is a unique identifier for the object itself.
- `actor`: This actor is a unique identifier corresponding to the creator of the object.
